I haven't used this to guage if a game is \"great\" or not. I hear about games through word of mouth and the constance advertisements that get thrown at me. Metacritic game scores have been around for a while and it may give some insights on how users percive the games the overall quality of the games. This is just a informal analysis of the metacritic scores attributed to games gathered over time. I'd like to see if I can learn anything about metacritic scores or about game industry.\nBelow is a description of the metacritic score:\n<br>Metascore is a weighted average in that we assign more importance, or weight, to some critics and publications than others, based on their quality and overall stature\nMetascores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better overall reviews. We highlight Metascores in three colors so that you can instantly compare: green scores for favorable reviews, yellow scores for mixed reviews, and red scores for unfavorable reviews.(https://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores)\nOur goal for this analysis is to see if there is any relationship we can between the metascore and other metrics that are provided\n   ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Reading Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import math\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport datetime as dt\nimport seaborn as sb","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('/Metacritic Games/metacritic_games.csv', parse_dates=['release_date'])\nprint(data.head(5))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style=\"font-size:13pt;\">  Reading in the data went well.

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion & Comments\n<span style=\"font-size:13pt;\">Based on the given data already as well as the infomation on the metacritic scores from metacritic's website we can also agree that the metacritic score is strongly based on critic's review. If we were provided data on the critics that review the games, we can potentially see which critics have a higher weight on the metascores that are assigned. It would have been nice to see the missing years of 2019 and onwards as there have been many new games and consoles that came out. It would have been interesting to see if any of the newer consoles would have made it on the top list or if any of the newer games would have bumped genres higher. A quick search of top PC  games in 2019 and 2020 included titles like DOOM, Half-Life, Valorant, Apex Legends, Call Of Duty Black Ops  and Call of Duty Modern Warfare were so popular at the time everyone I knew was playing those games.\n\n<span style=\"font-size:13pt;\">\nDuring the analysis I notice in the analysis is that the games usually have multiple genres. The dataset only included one genre per game. It'll be interesting to see how the genres were coded if the first genre tagged on a game was chosen. For example the game \"Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II\" is tagged as an action game while \"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" is tagged as a role-playing game. Dark Forces II does also have action-adventure qualities and Knights of the Old Republic does have some action aspects. So having the top genres of \"action\" , \"action-adventure\" and \"adventure\" may very well change if this is clarified. Genre's like \"Sci-fi\" would also get roped into action or adventure.\n <br>    \nAnother thing I notice in the analysis is that PC had an overwhelming number of games in the analysis. If we think about it, PCs themselves don't change as a console. PC's hardware can easily just get upgraded by swapping parts in and out. \nWhile acutal consoles will have to be purchased whole. For example in the above analysis, if we consider the top metascore average by platform, we can see that there are platforms such as PS2, PS3, PS4, Xbox, Xbox360. If we were to consolidate them into just Playstation and Xbox entirely, we can get 4,831 and 2,671 games respectively. By doing this the average scores can be shifted and we may find a platform with overwhelming preference.","metadata":{}}]}
